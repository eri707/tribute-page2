                    <p>Fiona Apple McAfee Maggart(born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and
                        record
                        producer. Classically trained on piano as a child. Apple began compsing her own songs when she
                        was eight
                        years old. Her debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was seventeen, was released in 1996 and
                        received a
                        Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocak Performance for the single "Criminal". She followed with
                        When
                        the Pawn...(1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially successful
                        and went
                        certified platinum.</p>
                    <p>For her third album, Extraordinary Machine(2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began
                        recording the album in 2002. However, Aplle was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted
                        not to
                        release the record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records, believin that the label
                        was
                        withholding its release. The album was eventually reporoduced without Brion and released in
                        October 2005
                        to critical acclaim. She released her fourth studio album, The idler Wheel..., in 2012, which
                        was
                        followed by an extensive tour of the USA. The album received universal praise.</p>
